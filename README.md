The Coffee Masters project is a simple and responsive web application inspired by a coffee shop order page. It provides a clean and minimalist user interface where users can view their selected items, see price details, and input their payment information. The layout is designed with warm coffee-themed colors that evoke the feeling of a cozy café while maintaining a modern and elegant appearance.

This project features an order summary section that lists all selected items along with descriptions and prices, making it easy for users to review their purchases before proceeding. The payment section includes fields for entering the customer’s name, card number, and CCV code, arranged neatly to ensure clarity and usability. Below the form, a subtotal, tax, and total are automatically displayed, giving a complete breakdown of the order cost. A visually appealing “Place Order” button is positioned at the bottom, styled to match the overall coffee-inspired design theme.

The project is built using HTML5 and CSS , with layout control achieved through Flexbox and Grid. It can optionally include custom fonts from Google Fonts to enhance the aesthetic. The structure is straightforward, consisting mainly of an index.html file for content, a styles.css file for styling, and a folder for images such as the logo.

The design is inspired by Brian Holt’s “Complete Intro to Web Development” project
 but includes personal modifications for a unique look and improved usability. The Coffee Masters project is open source under the MIT License, allowing anyone to modify and use it for learning or development purposes. It was built with passion and attention to detail using VS Code on Ubuntu in November 2025.
